This was a quick webapp I hacked together over a Saturday. It is simple enough - a one page application for donating a dollar a week to a designated content creator. It is no longer running live,
but you can check out the small codebase here. It have a real-time ticker to track dollars donated for the week as well as a PayPal button that calls PayPals payment API to carry out a donation transaction using
PayPals lite client to allow the user to login and submit a donation through their PayPal account. It also offers the ability to pay as a guest using a card. At the bottom of the page there is a field to enter your email
to subscribe to weekly newsletters which were delivered via MailChimp. The subscription was handled through the Springboot API.

Seeing as the backend API is no longer running and the Database has been shut down, the real-time ticker will not be active and the content creator information will not appear.

 The default React project readme instructions are below.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
